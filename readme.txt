Hello there, since you're reading this I want you to knoe that since thelukeweb beta 2.0 is out, I will be working on thelukewebINVERTED 3.0 so yeah.

All of thelukewebINVERTED releases are based off of the newest release of thelukeweb (at that time). It will also say in the readme downloaded WITH thelukewebINVERTED's releases which thelukeweb version it is based off of.
If there is anything you want me to add, just tweet me! @GamingboiLuke on twitter.
